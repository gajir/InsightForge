# GAJENTHINI ASAIRASAN - DATA ANALYST PROTFOLIO
##INTRODUCTION
In this case study, I will step into the role of a junior data analyst at a fictional company, Cyclistic, to tackle a series of real-world tasks. To effectively answer the key business questions, I will systematically follow the data analysis process. This process includes several essential steps: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. Each step will help me break down the problem, work with the data, derive insights, and ultimately make informed recommendations for the company.
