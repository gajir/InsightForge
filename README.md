# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Case Study
Course: [Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone)
## INTRODUCTION
In this case study, I will step into the role of a junior data analyst at a fictional company, Cyclistic, to tackle a series of real-world tasks. To effectively answer the key business questions, I will systematically follow the data analysis process. This process includes several essential steps: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. Each step will help me break down the problem, work with the data, derive insights, and ultimately make informed recommendations for the company.

## Background
### Cyclistic
Cyclistic, a bike-share program boasting over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations, distinguishes itself by offering not only traditional bikes but also reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes. This inclusivity makes the program accessible to people with disabilities and those who cannot use standard two-wheeled bikes. While most riders prefer traditional bikes, about 8% take advantage of these assistive options. Cyclistic users primarily ride for leisure, although around 30% use the service to commute to work daily.

Historically, Cyclistic's marketing strategy has focused on broad consumer segments and general awareness. A key factor in its success has been the flexibility of its pricing plans, which include single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who opt for single-ride or full-day passes are known as casual riders, while those who choose annual memberships are considered Cyclistic members.

Financial analysis has revealed that annual members are significantly more profitable than casual riders. While pricing flexibility has attracted a wide range of customers, Moreno, the director of marketing and my manager, believes that increasing the number of annual members is crucial for future growth. Instead of targeting entirely new customers, Moreno sees a strong opportunity to convert casual riders into annual members. Casual riders are already familiar with the Cyclistic program and have chosen it for their mobility needs, making them prime candidates for membership conversion.

Moreno has set a clear objective: to develop marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. To achieve this, the marketing analyst team must gain a deeper understanding of the differences between annual members and casual riders, the motivations behind casual riders purchasing memberships, and the role digital media could play in their marketing efforts. To inform these strategies, Moreno and her team plan to analyze historical bike trip data to uncover trends and insights.
### Scenario
As a junior data analyst on the marketing team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, I am tasked with supporting a strategic initiative led by our director of marketing. The director believes that the company’s future growth relies on increasing the number of annual memberships. To achieve this goal, my team is focused on understanding the differences in how casual riders and annual members utilize Cyclistic bikes. By analyzing these insights, we aim to develop a targeted marketing strategy designed to convert casual riders into annual members. However, before implementing any strategy, we must first secure approval from Cyclistic’s executives. This requires us to present our findings with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations to ensure our recommendations are well-supported and persuasive.
